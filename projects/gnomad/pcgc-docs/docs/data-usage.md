# What are the restrictions on data usage?

There are no restrictions or embargoes on the publication of results derived from the gnomAD database. However, we encourage people to [check with the consortium](mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com) before embarking on large-scale analyses, to see if we already have something currently underway that overlaps with your plans; generally, we prefer to collaborate with users rather than compete with them. The data are available under the [ODC Open Database License (ODbL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) (summary available [here](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/summary/)): you are free to share and modify the gnomAD data so long as you attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database; keep the resulting data-sets open; and offer your shared or adapted version of the dataset under the same ODbL license.
