# Classes of structural variants in gnomAD

Structural variants (SVs) are defined as genomic rearrangements involving at least 50bp of DNA, and are categorized into mutational classes based on their breakpoint signature(s) and/or changes in copy number.  

The mutational classes of SVs can be subdivided into two groups:  
  - **Unbalanced SVs** are rearrangements that result in gains or losses of genomic DNA (also known as **copy number variants**, or **CNVs**)  
  - **Balanced SVs** are rearrangements that do not involve changes in copy number  

Additionally, each SV can be described as _canonical_ or _complex_:
  - **Canonical SVs** are rearrangements that involve a single distinct breakpoint signature and/or changes in copy number
  - **Complex SVs** are rearrangements that involve two or more distinct breakpoint signatures and/or changes in copy number  

Each SV type indicated in the filter row has additional information on each class. Hover over each SV type with your mouse for now details. Each variant page also contains information for the SV class relevant for that SV.  

For more details on the detection and categorization of SVs in gnomAD, please refer to the [gnomAD SV preprint](https://broad.io/gnomad_sv), this [blog post](https://macarthurlab.org/2019/03/20/structural-variants-in-gnomad/), or the other help text fields located on this page.
