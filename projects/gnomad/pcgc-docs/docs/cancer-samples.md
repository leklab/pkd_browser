# Do the cancer samples in the database include tumor exomes, or is this from germline samples only?

All of the "cancer" samples in the current release of ExAC are blood ("germline") samples from TCGA. We excluded any sample labeled as tumor. However, note that some sample/label swaps may have occurred in TCGA; in addition, it is possible that in some patients the blood samples are contaminated by circulating tumor cells.
