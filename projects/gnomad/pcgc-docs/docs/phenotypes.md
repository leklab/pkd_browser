title: 'What phenotype data are available for individuals?'

## I have identified a rare variant in gnomAD that I believe is associated with a specific clinical phenotype. What phenotype data are available for these individuals?

Most of the individuals who have contributed data to gnomAD were not fully consented for phenotype data sharing, and unfortunately at this time we are typically unable to provide any information about the clinical status of variant carriers. We have made every effort to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the gnomAD data set, and certainly do not expect our data set to be enriched for such individuals, but we typically cannot rule out the possibility that some of our participants do actually suffer from your disease of interest.
