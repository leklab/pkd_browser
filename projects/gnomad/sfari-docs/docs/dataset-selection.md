# Selecting datasets

The data selection drop-down specifies which dataset is displayed on the page. Currently these are:

+ gnomAD v2.1
+ gnomAD v2.1 (controls): Only samples from individuals who were not selected as a case in a case/control study of common disease
+ gnomAD v2.1 (non-cancer): Only samples from individuals who were not ascertained for having cancer in a cancer study
+ gnomAD v2.1 (non-neuro): Only samples from individuals who were not ascertained for having a neurological condition in a neurological case/control study
+ gnomAD v2.1 (non-TOPMed): Only samples that are not present in the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)/BRAVO release. The allele counts in this subset can thus be added to those of BRAVO to federate both datasets.
+ ExAC v1.0 (same data from [exac.broadinstitute.org](exac.broadinstitute.org))
+ gnomAD SVs: Structural variant (SV) calls generated from a set of WGS samples that largely overlaps those in gnomAD v2.1. This current SV release includes 10,738 unrelated genomes. See the [gnomAD-SV preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/578674v1) for details.

The data selection drop-down also updates accompanying data such as the coverage plot, constraint statistics, regional constraint, and variant positional distribution plot.
