# Include filtered variants

Enabling this checkbox will include variants that did not pass our quality control process.

If filtered variants are included, the data source icons in the variant table will be distinguished with reduced opacity and a dotted border to indicate lower reliability. A variantâ€™s filter status can be discovered by hovering over the icon (e.g. AC0, RF).

As the filtering process was performed on exomes and genomes separately, users will notice that for some variants, we have 2 filter statuses which may be discordant in some cases.

Be careful when including filtered variants: some poor quality variants (and summary statistics) will be added to the table. This feature should be used with caution.
