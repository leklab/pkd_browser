## About the MacArthur Lab

We are a tight-knit research group jointly based as [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/) and the [Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT](http://www.broadinstitute.org/), and leveraging the largest genomic data sets in the world and cutting-edge analysis methods to make sense of human genetic variation. Weâ€™re committed to open data and open-source code, as well as [experimenting with new methods of communication](http://slackhq.com/post/117531540875/slack-inside-the-macarthur-lab). Working with us is a chance to learn from experts in computational biology, large-scale genomics, variant interpretation, software development and clinical genomics, as well as to make a difference to the lives of hundreds of families affected by rare diseases.
