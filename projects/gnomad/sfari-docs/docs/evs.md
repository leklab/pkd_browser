# Are all the individuals in the Exome Variant Server included?

No. We were not given permission from dbGaP to include individuals from several of the cohorts included in the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. As a result, genuine rare variants that are present in the EVS may not be observed in gnomAD.
