## ![](https://placehold.it/15/397246/000000?text=+) Breakends (BND)  

Classification: _Incompletely resolved single breakpoint; not a complete SV_

![Breakend (BND)](gnomAD_browser.SV_schematics_BND.png)  

Breakends are components of incompletely resolved SVs that represent single non-reference sequence junctions with unknown or unspecified alternate allele structures. The majority of BNDs likely correspond to small sequence insertions, but some fraction of BNDs also represent inversions, translocations, more complex rearrangements, or computational false-positives.

Breakends are not considered filter-passing variants in the gnomAD SV VCF, and thus were excluded from all analyses in [the gnomAD SV paper](https://broad.io/gnomad_sv).
