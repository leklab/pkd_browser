## ![](https://placehold.it/15/71E38C/000000?text=+) Deletion-flanked inversions (delINV & INVdel)  

Classification: _unbalanced complex SV_

#### Configuration A (delINV)

Deletion-flanked inversions are complex SVs involving an inversion with a deletion at either the 5' or 3' breakpoint. When the deletion occurs at the 5' breakpoint, the SV is labeled as `delINV`; in the case of 3' deletions, the SV is labeled as `INVdel`. The two configurations of deletion-flanked inversion, `delINV` and `INVdel`, are molecularly indistinguishable, but are differentiated in gnomAD for the purposes of interpreting which side of the inversion is linked to the deletion relative to the reference genome assembly.
